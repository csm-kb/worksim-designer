# Work Sim 1980 Design Tool

A lightweight sim design helper tool for a side project of mine, which takes elements of Bitburner's corporation gameplay and smashes it together with my own long-running vision for a sim game inspired by Job Simulator (the VR game).

Showcases creating custom components as wrappers for external libraries, such as the `Chart` component from [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

This was spawned from the `vite-vanjs-ts` template.
